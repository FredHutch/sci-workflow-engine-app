This is a [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) app that you can use to interact with a Cromwell server.

  For Fred Hutch people, you can get a [Cromwell](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) server one of two ways:

  - PROOF: Login with your Hutchnet username and password, then start a Cromwell server on the **Cromwell servers** page (uses the [PROOF service](https://github.com/FredHutch/proof-api))
  - DIY: Get a Cromwell server running by yourself (does not require logging in). To learn more about how to get your Cromwell server running, read through the instructions in the GitHub repo [FredHutch/diy-cromwell-server](https://github.com/FredHutch/diy-cromwell-server)

  Once you have a Cromwell server running (via either of the two routes above), then you can use this app on campus (or on VPN) to interact with your server
