### What is this app?
This is a basic shiny app that you can use once you have used the Fred Hutch HPC system to get a Cromwell server running on the `gizmo` cluster.  To learn more about how to get your Cromwell server running, read through the instructions in this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/FredHutch/diy-cromwell-server) or contact Amy Paguirigan for assistance (Fred Hutch email `apaguiri`, or GitHub user `vortexing`).  Once you have a Cromwell server running, then you can use this app on campus (or on VPN) to interact with your server to do things like validate a workflow you'd like to run, run said workflow, abort a workflow or use the tracking tab to see how all of your workflows are doing.  

If you have issues or wishlist items for this app specifically, please file them as issues in the GitHub repo [for this Cromwell app](https://github.com/FredHutch/shiny-cromwell).  You can also ask questions about the app, Cromwell or WDL in general over in The Coop's [Slack channel for cromwell-wdl](https://fhbig.slack.com/archives/CTFU13URJ).
